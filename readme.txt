Megathread maximizes the value of your Wordpress and BuddyPress comments through Community Based Analytics that can extend across any platform.

== Description ==

Are you looking to get more value and understanding out of your WordPress or BuddyPress comments and community?  Megathread's plugin for WordPress and BuddyPress ranks the top tags, people, posts, discussions and communities based on levels of influence around specific topics of interest.  Megathread then goes out and finds other people, posts, discussions, and communities that are most relevant to your site.  The end result is the simplest and most accurate tool for understanding, educating, managing, targeting and connecting with your audience across the Web.

Megathread helps individual users build social influence and relevance within and outside of your community.  

This plugin supports WordPress and BuddyPress discussions only.

Please note this is our first public release of our product.  If you have any questions, concerns, or want to report a bug please contact me directly: brian (at) megathread (dot) com.



== Benefits == 

  Targeting: Increase your ability to "see and be seen" across multiple platforms in the subjects of interest that are most relevant and meaningful to your online community.
 
  Awareness: Receive a comprehensive understanding of the most influential and relevant factors that apply to your site, your peers, and like-minded communities.

  Credibility: Generate authentic social credentials--for you, your content, and your members--and utilize their benefits across the Web.

Over time we will be building the Megathread community via other blogs, forums and discussion platforms which will directly improve the cross-platform benefits Megathread provides your blog.
